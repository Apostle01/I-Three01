## Design

### Colour Scheme

![I-Three01 Colour Palette](docs/Colour-Scheme.png)

I opted for a clean modern colour palette where each colour complements one another. The palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- **Roboto** is used across the site for all text. It is a sans-serif font.

### Imagery

All images on the webpage were taken from Unsplash.com. I have credited these in the [Credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

- [Mobile](docs/wireframe.jpg)
- [Desktop](docs/wireframe1.jpg)
 
### Features

The website consists of three pages and a modal: Home, Packages, Gallery, and a Booking modal.

#### All three pages share the following elements:
- A responsive navigation bar at the top of the page allows the user to easily explore the website. On smaller devices, the navigation links are condensed into a burger toggler button to prevent the bar from looking cluttered.
 
- A footer comprising social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, along with the company's address.

### Home Page

- [Screenshot of Home page](assets/img/Home-Page.png)
Learn about our salon, our mission, and our commitment to excellence.

### Home Page: Learn about our salon, our mission, and our commitment to excellence.
 - Four different images of clean styled dreadlocks in the header.
 - A heading and paragraph explaining who I-Three are.
 - Four different images of clean styled dreadlocks in the header.

#### Packages Page

Explore our service packages, pricing, and special offers.

- Three packages are available: Starter, Maintenance, and Styling Perfection.
- Text explains the packages.
- A "Book Now" button under the packages directs users to the booking modal.
  <ul>
<li>Starter</li>
<li>Maintainance</li>
<li>Styling Perfection</li>
<a href="Booking.html">Booking.html</a>
</ul>

#### Gallery Page

View stunning photos of our clients’ dreadlocks transformations.

- A grid gallery showcasing I-Three's completed work, providing users confidence in the company’s ability.

#### Booking Modal

- A modal which is initiated from a Booking button on the nav bar and the packages page.
- A form within the modal that requires the users input.

### Accessibility

I've taken care when coding to make the website user-friendly. This was done by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes for images throughout the site.
- Selecting a sans-serif font which is suitable for users with dyslexia.
- Ensuring that the site has adequate amount of colour contrast.

5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing

Testing was continuous throughout the website build. I used Chrome developer tools to identify and address any issues as they arose.

- Upon meeting with my mentor, we identified that my initial colour scheme had contrast issues. This has been resolved by choosing a new colour scheme that allows for adequate contrast been background and foreground colours.

- My mentor also pointed out that the images within the website were .png format which hindered the performance of the website. To combat this some images have been converted to .jpg format to significantly improve performance.

- On the Packages page. the list items were out of alignment and not centered even after using the bootstrap text-center class. This was due to padding, which has now been removed to center the list of items.

### Manual and Automated Testing
- Both automated and manual testing have their place in the software development lifecycle. Automated testing is best for repetitive, time-consuming tasks and ensures a high level of accuracy and efficiency. In contrast, manual testing is crucial for understanding the user experience, performing exploratory testing, and adapting to new, unforeseen test scenarios. By leveraging both types of testing, teams can ensure comprehensive test coverage, higher quality software, and a better user experience.

### W3C Validator

W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

One issue I was coming across when testing my html page was an error displayed by w3. Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.
